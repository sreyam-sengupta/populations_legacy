# Populations
Efficacy of active regulation vs passive bet-hedging in colonies of single-celled organisms.

## Files
*0_populations_basic.ipynb* is the basic file containing a working solver for the nonlinear 1D FP equation that is our toy model.

*1_populations_fitness_function.ipynb* generates a fitness contour map.

 *2a_populations_static_env_precise_sensing.ipynb* calculates fitness and information phase diagrams for various parameter pairs (alpha, delta) over ten different equally-spaced static sugar environments between 60 to 430 microM. Two phase diagrams showing the benefit conferred by regulation (post-selection) compared to selection without regulation are generated. The fitness conferred per bit of information in the post-selection case with regulation is calculated and a phase diagram generated.
